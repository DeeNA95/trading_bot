📌 What’s Left to Discuss Before Development?

1️⃣ Confirm the final trading market (Crypto, Stocks, or Forex).
2️⃣ Decide final data sources & indicators to use.
3️⃣ Lock in the RL model (PPO confirmed, but should we consider A2C?).
4️⃣ Define the full backtesting workflow.

🚀 Once these are finalized, we move to implementation! 🚀

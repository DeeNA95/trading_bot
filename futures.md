Yes, there are several important considerations when moving from spot to futures trading that might affect your training approach and data handling:

Leverage dynamics: Futures trading typically involves leverage, which amplifies both profits and losses. Your model should be trained to understand and manage leverage-related risks, potentially with more conservative position sizing strategies.
Shorting capabilities: Futures make it much easier to short the market. Your training data and reward function should account for profitable short opportunities, not just long positions.
Funding rates: Perpetual futures contracts have funding rates that don't exist in spot trading. These can significantly impact profitability, especially for positions held across funding periods. Consider incorporating funding rate data as a feature.
Liquidation risk: With leverage comes the risk of liquidation. Your model should be trained to avoid scenarios that could lead to liquidation, possibly by incorporating drawdown penalties in the reward function.
Price divergence: Futures prices can temporarily diverge from spot prices due to market sentiment, affecting the reliability of certain technical indicators. Your model might need to account for the basis (difference between futures and spot prices).
Higher volatility: Futures markets often exhibit higher volatility than spot markets. Your risk management approach in training may need adjustment to handle these larger price swings.
Different market participants: Futures markets attract more professional traders and larger players, potentially changing how price patterns form and evolve.
I would recommend:

Updating your features to include futures-specific data (funding rates, open interest, liquidations)
Adjusting your reward function to account for leverage and liquidation risk
Possibly retraining on futures market data specifically rather than spot data
Testing more conservative risk parameters initially
These changes would help your model better adapt to the specific characteristics of futures trading.

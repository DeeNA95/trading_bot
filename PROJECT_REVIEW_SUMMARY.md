# Project Review Summary (Institutional Benchmark)

This document summarizes the key findings from the review of the Pyraformer/PPO trading bot project, benchmarked against institutional-grade standards.

## Critical Flaws

These issues fundamentally undermine the reliability of the current system, especially backtesting results.

1.  **Backtesting Lookahead Bias (SL/TP Logic):** The environment uses current bar high/low prices to determine stop-loss/take-profit fills within the *same* bar, leading to unrealistically perfect fills and inflated performance metrics (`trading_env.py`).
2.  **Missing Slippage/Latency in Backtesting:** The backtester only accounts for fixed commission fees, completely ignoring variable slippage and order/data latency, which are critical in real futures trading (`trading_env.py`).
3.  **Flawed Data Imputation:** Using `fillna(0)` for missing data or infinities introduces significant artificial information and bias, corrupting the data used for training and evaluation (`train.py`).
4.  **Potential Critical Bug in Reward Function:** The `FuturesRiskAdjustedReward` logic appears to incorrectly convert losses into positive rewards under certain leverage conditions, which would severely mislead the agent's learning (`reward.py`).

## Major Weaknesses

These represent significant gaps compared to robust institutional practices.

*   **Inadequate Validation Methodology:** A single train/test split is insufficient for non-stationary financial data; walk-forward validation is necessary (`train.py`).
*   **Data Source/Pipeline Issues:** Reliance on a single API source (Binance), potential lookahead bias in feature calculation, lack of rigorous data validation, and potential performance bottlenecks (`data.py`, `train.py`).
*   **Reward Function Complexity & Tuning:** The risk-adjusted reward function is complex, highly sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, and its interactions might encourage excessive risk (`reward.py`).
*   **Agent/Model Stability & Potential Bugs:** Concerns about RL stability despite NaN handling; potential bugs in optimizer initialization and evaluation determinism (`ppo_agent.py`, `models.py`).
*   **Risky Position Sizing:** Kelly Criterion implementation is highly sensitive to estimation errors and risky with short lookback windows (`position_sizer.py`).
*   **Lack of Operational Rigor:** Absence of unit/integration tests, experiment tracking tools (MLflow/W&B), and explicit random seed setting hinders reproducibility and systematic development (`train.py`, `ppo_agent.py`).

## Other Concerns

*   **Code Duplication:** Dynamic leverage calculation logic is repeated (`position_sizer.py`, `trading_env.py`).
*   **Model Complexity:** PyraFormer is ambitious but less validated in finance than standard models; reliance on only the last time step output might be limiting (`models.py`).
*   **Simplistic Action Space:** Discrete (Hold, Long, Short) action space limits strategy expressiveness (e.g., scaling in/out) (`trading_env.py`).
*   **Reliance on External APIs:** Using non-exchange APIs (e.g., `aifinalytics.com`) for live data introduces reliability risks (`trading_env.py`).

# Implementation Plan for Hydra and Optuna Integration in RL Agent

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to integrate Hydra for configuration management and Optuna for hyperparameter optimization into the RL agent training pipeline. The objective is to enhance modularity, reproducibility, and efficiency in tuning reinforcement learning experiments using the PPO agent with Gym environments.

## Goals

- Migrate all training, model, environment, and PPO hyperparameters into structured Hydra configuration files.
- Enable hyperparameter optimization using Optuna’s TPE sampler targeting mean validation reward.
- Support checkpoint resume functionality within training.
- Maintain a clean separation of concerns between core training code and experiment orchestration.
- Use Hydra’s default logging and output directory behavior to track configurations, logs, and results for each Optuna trial.
- Facilitate efficient sequential hyperparameter search with an early stopping criterion.
- Organize new experiment-related code under the `trading_bot/experiments/` directory.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### Step 1: Hydra Configuration Refactor

- **Objectives:**
  - Create a modular set of YAML configuration files under `trading_bot/conf/`.
  - Define clear configuration groups to mirror the argument structure documented in `trainer_args.md`.
    - Environment configuration (data, symbols, window size, leverage, etc.)
    - Model architecture configuration
    - PPO hyperparameters
    - Training loop / walk-forward validation settings
    - Checkpoint and resume options
  - Use type-safe overrides via Hydra's config composition mechanism.
  - Enable easy hyperparameter overrides when launching experiments.
  
- **Deliverables:**
  - YAML config files for each major configuration group.
  - Schema validation (using OmegaConf and Hydra) for correctness.
  - Documentation in the config files for each key.

### Step 2: Optuna Objective Function Integration

- **Objectives:**
  - Develop a Python function wrapping a full training run that Optuna will optimize over.
  - Translate Optuna trial parameters into Hydra config overrides to run training with those hyperparameters.
  - Evaluate the mean validation reward and return it as the metric for Optuna optimization.
  - Implement an early stopping mechanism in the objective if reward crosses 1,000,000.
  - Support resuming training using a checkpoint path specified in the config.

- **Deliverables:**
  - An `objective` function fully type-annotated and documented.
  - Proper exception handling and logging for trial failures.
  - Logging of trial parameters and results into Hydra output directories.

### Step 3: Experiment Driver Script

- **Objectives:**
  - Implement `optimize.py` under `trading_bot/experiments/` to:
    - Load Hydra configurations.
    - Initialize and configure an Optuna study with TPE sampler.
    - Execute hyperparameter search sequentially.
    - Log trial results and best parameters.
  - Ensure each Optuna trial has a unique Hydra output directory for traceability.

- **Deliverables:**
  - A standalone, documented script to start hyperparameter optimization.
  - CLI integration using Hydra’s launcher syntax.
  - Clear log outputs and summaries after study completion.

### Step 4: Logging and Output Management

- **Objectives:**
  - Leverage Hydra’s output directory mechanism to organize per-trial logs and configs.
  - Persist Optuna study results (parameters, metrics, best trial info) as JSON/CSV files in each trial’s output folder.
  - Enable easy integration with cloud storage (e.g., GCS) by storing all outputs in a mounted or synced directory.
  - Provide utility scripts (if needed) to summarize or aggregate results across trials.

- **Deliverables:**
  - Trial-level JSON/CSV logs of hyperparameters and metrics.
  - Documentation on file structure and location.
  - Optional helper utilities for post-experiment analysis.

### Step 5: Resume-from-Checkpoint Support

- **Objectives:**
  - Add `checkpoint_path` support to Hydra config that is used by the training workflow.
  - Ensure training logic reads the checkpoint path and resumes training seamlessly.
  - Provide CLI/config override to activate resume mode.
  - Document how to resume from an arbitrary checkpoint.

- **Deliverables:**
  - Config support and validation for checkpoint path.
  - Tested resume behavior in training pipeline.
  - Usage instructions in experiment documentation.

### Step 6: Documentation and Testing

- **Objectives:**
  - Write `plan.md` (this document) and additional markdown files as appropriate.
  - Provide clear instructions for running optimization experiments.
  - Write basic integration tests or usage examples for the optimization pipeline (optional at this stage, based on priority).
  - Ensure clean, modular, maintainable code with thorough docstrings and type hints.

- **Deliverables:**
  - This plan document.
  - README or usage notes in `trading_bot/experiments/`.
  - Test scaffolding if feasible.

## Summary

This plan ensures a robust, extensible architecture for reinforcement learning experiment management leveraging Hydra and Optuna’s capabilities. By organizing configs, training, and optimization clearly and modularly, the project will gain in maintainability and scalability, with clear pathways to future extensions such as distributed trials or advanced experiment tracking integrations.

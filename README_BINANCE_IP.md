# Handling Binance IP Restrictions

When using the Binance API with IP restrictions, you need to ensure that your current IP address is whitelisted in your Binance account settings. This guide explains how to handle this for local development.

## Your Current Public IP

Your current public IP address is: `54.161.180.89`

## Adding Your IP to Binance Whitelist

1. Log in to your Binance account
2. Go to API Management
3. Find your API key
4. Click "Edit Restrictions"
5. Add your current IP address (`54.161.180.89`) to the IP whitelist
6. Save changes

## Handling Dynamic IP Addresses

If your IP address changes frequently (e.g., when using a home internet connection without a static IP):

### Option 1: Use a VPN with a Static IP

1. Subscribe to a VPN service that offers static IP addresses
2. Connect to the VPN using the static IP
3. Add the VPN's static IP to your Binance API whitelist

### Option 2: Update IP Regularly

1. Create a script to check your current IP address
2. When your IP changes, update your Binance API settings manually

### Option 3: Use Binance Testnet

For development and testing, consider using the Binance Testnet which may have more relaxed IP restrictions:

```python
from execution import BinanceExecutor

# Use testnet
binance = BinanceExecutor(testnet=True)
```

## Error Handling

The `BinanceExecutor` class is designed to detect IP restriction errors and provide clear guidance:

```python
try:
    binance = BinanceExecutor()
    account_info = binance.get_account_info()
except ValueError as e:
    if "IP restriction error" in str(e):
        print("Please update your Binance API whitelist with your current IP")
```

## Checking Your IP Programmatically

You can check your current public IP at any time:

```python
import requests
current_ip = requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').text
print(f"Your current public IP: {current_ip}")
```

Remember to always keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control.

4. Implementation Approach
Here's a phased implementation plan:

Phase 1: Environment Development
Build market simulator with historical data
Implement action space with realistic constraints
Design reward function with risk-adjustment
Phase 2: Agent Development
Implement SAC architecture with appropriate neural networks
Set up experience replay and training loop
Configure hyperparameters for training
Phase 3: Training & Evaluation
Train on historical data with cross-validation
Evaluate using out-of-sample periods
Implement backtesting framework
Phase 4: Deployment & Execution
Connect to Alpaca API for live execution
Implement logging and monitoring
Set up risk management guardrails
